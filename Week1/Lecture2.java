 * Class: a "blueprint" of an object
 * Variable must have both a type and identifier:
 * - Memory declaration simply stores memory, (amount of memory based on type)
 * - Names are case sensative
 * - Names musn't start with numbers
 * - Names start with letters and underscores and is followed by numbers and underscores
 * - Name should be typed in camelCase
 * - Constants are defined with the keyword double, which makes the variable immutable (ex. final double PI)
 * - Cannot assign an inappropriate/incompatible type to a variable[]
