/*
Interpreted languages read line by line to determine what steps to execute. (ex. Python or PHP)
One can write the source code and so long as an interpreter exists, one can run the code anywhere.

Compiled languages grab source code and run it through a compiler which translates it into machine code for the specific platform. (ex. C or C++)
Once compiled, an executable file is generated and run during run time.

Java is both a hybrid interpreted and compiled language. During compile time, the source code is run the javac (Java compiler). 
hen, the Java Bytecode generates java's 1's and 0's in a class file. During run time, the class file is run through the JRE/JVM 
(Java Runtime Environment) which executes the Bytecode.
